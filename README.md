## Objective

Develop a robust machine learning model to accurately predict fraudulent car insurance claims based on historical data in the `fraud_oracle.csv` dataset.

## Dataset

The `fraud_oracle.csv` dataset contains 33 variables, including 24 categorical and 9 numerical features, related to car insurance claims.

## Methodology

This Jupyter notebook, `car_insurance_fraud_YG.ipynb`, explores and analyzes the dataset through various steps:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Visualizing distributions of numerical features.
* Examining relationships between categorical features and potential fraud.
* Identifying and handling missing values.

**2. Feature Engineering:**

* Creating new features based on existing ones to enhance model performance.
* Encoding categorical features for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

**3. Model Development:**

* Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models for fraud prediction, potentially including:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Random Forest
    * XGBoost
    * Neural Networks
* Optimizing hyperparameters for each model to achieve the best performance.

**4. Model Evaluation:**

* Assessing the performance of the selected model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Analyzing the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Expected Outcomes

* Identify a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting fraudulent car insurance claims.
* Gain valuable insights into factors associated with fraudulent claims.
* Develop a model that can potentially assist insurance companies in reducing fraudulent payouts.

## Further Exploration

* Investigate feature importance to understand which factors most influence fraud prediction.
* Implement ensemble methods to combine the strengths of different models.
* Explore more advanced deep learning architectures for fraud detection.
